# Project 100: Unreal Engine

Welcome to **Project 100: Unreal Engine**, a collection of 100 gameplay mechanics built entirely with Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5.  
Each mechanic includes:
- Blueprint screenshots
- Step-by-step GIFs
- Playable demo
- Source files in the main mega-project

This repo is designed for developers and learners to explore, understand, and reuse each mechanic in their own projects.

If you want, I can also write a **template README.md for each mechanic** (like `simpleMovement/README.md`) with placeholders for images, GIFs, and playable builds so you can just copy-paste for all future mechanics.  

Do you want me to do that next?
